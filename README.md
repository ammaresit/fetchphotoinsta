Fetch Photo from Instagram both hashtags and usernames

Depending on your connection speed, you can fetch 1k photos in 15 seconds!

!Works on only Windows platforms!

First you need to start server in your localhost on port 80 (can be editable by code), move "/test" directory into localhost main directory. Then open "keyword" and "username" files individually and edit instagram account login information according to yours -do not panic, this is not sending your data to anywhere secretly- (is really not? :)). Congrats! You are ready to run the program!

" C:\FetchPhotos " will be your default folder to see photos (can also be editable by code).

P.S: There is a timeout which 120 seconds for requesting via API. So after 120 secs, program might show an error then exit.
